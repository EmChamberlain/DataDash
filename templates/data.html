  <h3>Understanding the Stats:</h3>
  <p><b>Count:</b> You submitted {{count | safe}} student test scores.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Mean:</b> The average test score was {{mean | safe}}. It is
    calculated by adding all the scores together and dividing by the count. The
    mean is a good overall representation of the middle value scored by your
    class.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Standard Deviation:</b> Your standard deviation was {{std |
    safe}}. Standard deviation tells you how spread out the data is, it is a
    measure of how far each observed value is from the average. The larger the
    standard deviation, the more spread out your data is. For your quiz, 95% of
    your students scored between {{ lower }} and {{ mean + std}}.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Min:</b> The minimun score was {{min |
    safe}}.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>25th Percentile:</b> The 25th percentile for the quiz was {{ q1 | safe}}.
    In other words, this is the first quartile. This means that a quarter of the
    test scores were below this score. On the other hand, three-quarters of the
    test scores were above this value.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>50th Percentile:</b> The 50th percentile for the quiz was {{q2 | safe}}.
    This is the second quantile. Half of the test scores were
    below this score and half were above. Similar to the mean, this value is
    also good for getting a good sense of the middle value of the test score.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>75th Percentile:</b> The 75th percentile for the quiz was {{q3 | safe}}.
    This is considered the third quantile. This means that three-quarters of the
    test scores were above this score. On the other hand, one quarter of the
    test scores were below this value.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Max:</b> The maximum score was {{max |
    safe}}.
